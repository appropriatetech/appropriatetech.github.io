Appropriate technology (AT) is technology that is designed with special consideration to the environmental, ethical, cultural, social and economical aspects of the community it is intended for. With these goals in mind, AT typically requires fewer resources, is easier to maintain, has a lower overall cost and less of an impact on the environment compared to industrialized practices. Most importantly, Appropriate Technology is technology to empower people.

The [International Network on Appropriate Technology (INAT)](inat) works to bring Appropriate Technology to the forefront of discussion and practice regarding science and technology.
